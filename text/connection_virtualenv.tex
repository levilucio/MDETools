\section{Connecting to the Virtual Environment}
\label{sec:connect_virtual_env}

The logic of the controller for the rover that us generated in \clang can then
run in an infinite loop, cycling over reading the inputs from the sensors in the
rover and then computing and sending values to its actuators. The \clang
code that is generated for the generic architecture only provides the
interface for the functions that read the sensors and send commmands on the
actuators of the virtual environment. Because of that, a manual step of
coding such methods and connecting the controller with the virtual environment
via TCP was additionally necessary to connect the controller to the rover.
